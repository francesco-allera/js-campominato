## Languages used:

- JAVASCRIPT ES5

### Purpose of the exercise:

Practicing more advanced notions of JavaScript ES5 (variable scope, switch case).

Ask the user for a difficulty to change the range of random numbers: difficulty 0, numbers between 1 and 100; difficulty 1, numbers between 1 and 80; difficulty 2, numbers between 1 and 50.
Generate 16 random numbers from those chosen by the difficulty.
Ask the user to enter one number at a time, always from those chosen by the difficulty.
If the number is present in the list of generated numbers, the game ends, otherwise it continues by asking the user for another number.
The game ends when the player enters a "forbidden" number or reaches the maximum possible number of numbers allowed.
At the end of the game, the software must report the score, that is, the number of times the user has entered an allowed number.
